Project Overview
This project aims to predict the maximum temperature of the next day using historical weather data and machine learning techniques.
By analysing patterns in temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and other meteorological variables, the model forecasts the next day's maximum temperature with strong accuracy and good interpretability.
